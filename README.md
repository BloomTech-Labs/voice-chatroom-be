## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

## User Actions

`find()` -> Returns all users

`findById(id)` -> Returns a single user by ID

`add(user)` -> Returns the created user

`update(changes, id)` -> Update a user by ID

`remove(id)` -> Delete user by ID


## Mentor actions 

`find()` -> Returns all mentors

`findById(id)` -> Returns a single mentor by ID

`add(mentor)` -> Returns the created mentor

`update(changes, id)` -> Update a mentor by ID

`remove(id)` -> Delete mentor by ID

## Category actions 

`findCat()` -> Returns all categories

`findCatById(id)` -> Returns a single category by ID

`addCat(cat)` -> Returns the created category

`updateCat(changes, id)` -> Update a category by ID

`removeCat(id)` -> Delete category by ID



## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
    
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
